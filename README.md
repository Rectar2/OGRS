OGRS
====

**OGRS**, the Open-source Game Rating System, was designed as a replacement for TIGRS, The Independent Game Rating System. TIGRS became very popular, but the website was eventually taken down for unknown reasons. I decided to rewrite my own version, using an [archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20110728111855/http://www.tigrs.org/?page=generate) of the page as a reference.

I've hosted OGRS at the following site:
